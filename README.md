            ## Art is Life
            
            This is a static HTML website that showcases my portfolio of work. It includes a homepage, about page, and contact page.
            
            ## Deployment
            
            This website is hosted on Netlify at https://lifeisart.netlify.app/
            
            To deploy changes to the website, simply push commits to the "main" branch. Netlify will automatically rebuild and redeploy the site.
            
            ## Development
            
            To run the website locally, clone this repository and open the "index.html" file in your web browser.
