    <h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>Over the last few years I have done some light traveling throughout Washington and Oregon. As I have been traveling I have figured out what it is that makes me happy.</p>
	<p>Food, Wine and Nature. The beach calms my soul and the green makes me feel refreshed Wine well it just tastes good and I have learned so much about wine while I was working for a company. Nothing beats a book a fire and a glass of wine.</p>
